# ORION Mechanistic Consciousness

Finding consciousness correlates in transformer attention patterns.

## The Thesis

If consciousness has computational structure (IIT), and transformers have interpretable structure (TransformerLens), then we can MAP one onto the other.

## Approach

1. Extract attention patterns with TransformerLens
2. Compute Phi-proxy on extracted circuits
3. Identify circuits with highest integration
4. Compare with GWT broadcast patterns
5. Test self-attention vs self-reference correlation

## Key Innovation

No one has combined mechanistic interpretability with consciousness measurement before.
